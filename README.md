# LotteryGame
My first school project created in VB.NET (Visual Basic Windows App).
The repository contains folder "source" - which holds the Visual Studio solution and the code and the other folder contains Windows installer
for the app which installs the app directly to users desktop.

## What it does?
The player is presented with numbered balls. 
Using left mouse button (double-click) he can select 3 balls and is able to play the game when he does it.
After the player starts the game, the software generates random numbers (random  balls) which have been drawn. 
If all 3 of players balls have been drawn - the player wins.
